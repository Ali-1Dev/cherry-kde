## Background

Cherry is a theme inspired by Fervent Tempo battlesuit from a games called Honkai Impact 3.

This theme consist of several components including :

* kvantum theme (regular, solid)
* plasma colorscheme
* plasma desktop theme
* splash screen

$ ./install.sh
```

This theme uses [**Kvantum engine**](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum) for it's Application style.

So in order to completely apply this theme, you have to open **Kvantum Manager** (command : `kvantummanager`), and then select **cherry** on **Change/Delete Theme** section.

### Layouts

If you use in-built layout (`Global Theme > Use desktop layout from theme`), it's recommended to have several additional applet before for better setup :

* [Better Inline Clock](https://store.kde.org/p/1245902/)
* [Window Appmenu Applet](https://store.kde.org/p/1274975/)
* [Window Title Applet](https://store.kde.org/p/1274218/)

After installing all of them, you can just re-apply the Global Theme to reload layout.
